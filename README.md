# Dartcoin: A Crypto Framework


## What you built? 

I built a (local) custom cryptocurrency built on flask and python. 

Include some screenshots.
[How?](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files)

## Who Did What?

I worked as the primary developer, PM, and motivator.

## What you learned

I learned how to use python/flask development. I learned how to use pip to set up a Crypto environment using python (pycryptodome). I also learned the core functionality of crypto.

## What Worked

The functionality of the website works, and the concept i think is really interesting. I'm able to send a bunch of money to anyone, and have it correctly displaed on the blockchain.

## What Didn't work:

Since it's only a local program, no changes are permanent. When the program ends, so does the program. There are also small issues with self-mining that I couldn't fix. If a person sends 1 coin to another person, they can mine that block and get 10 as a reward. I could lower the reward or enforce a minimum coin amount but that wouldn't be in the spirit of free trading on the blockchain.
